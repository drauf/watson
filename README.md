## About the project

Watson is a Java thread dump and CPU usage analyzer.

It combines the best features of other popular Java TDAs and hides a lot of noise, like idle Tomcat threads waiting for work.

## Gathering thread dumps

To fully leverage Watson, you should capture Java thread dump **and** top outputs.

The easiest way to do this is to use [Atlassian Support scripts](https://bitbucket.org/atlassianlabs/atlassian-support/src/master/).
